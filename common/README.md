### This package acts as a common module shared between the backend and the frontend. It contains the following modules:
 - Zod - A library for runtime type checking and validation in TypeScript.

In this project, Zod helps us infer the backend data type which can be used by our frontend to validate the data type. This is a very useful library for us to maintain the data type consistency between the backend and the frontend.
